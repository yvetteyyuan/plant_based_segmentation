# plant_based_segmentation
Having global markets adopt a plant-based diet offers a viable solution to avert an antibiotic crisis, reduces global climate change, feeds the global population with high quality protein and addresses animal suffering. It is critical to understand consumer sentiments towards plant-based products and deliver the right message to different segments.  

The goal of this project is to provide a picture of how online communities perceive topics around plant-based diet and products. The analysis explores Twitter discussions around hashtags #plantbased, #vegetarian, and #protein using Word Frequency Analysis, Word Cloud, Comparison of Sentiment Lexicons, Word's Contribution to Sentiment, Bigram Networks, etc. in R, thereby generating business insights on the plant-based meat market. 

The datasets were pulled from Twitter on Feburary 10, 2020, but the analysis can easily apply to current data or at any point of time.
